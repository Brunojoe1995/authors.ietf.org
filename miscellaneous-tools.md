There are a number of miscellaneous tools that authors may find useful:

- **[ietf-cli](https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietf-cli/)**
A multi-functional command line tool for manipulating I-Ds and RFCs and local repositories.

- **[print_rfc_or_draft](https://www.kumari.net/index.php/programming/programmingcat/45-printrfcordraft)**
A simple program that prints an Internet Draft (ID) or RFC. Because of the difference between the number of lines on laser printers and line / dot-matrix printers, each "page" of the draft actually takes up 2 pages and you end up with lots of pages with just a one line footer. This script tries to fix that by downloading the draft, converting it to a PDF and then printing it.

- **[Rewrite IETF ID URLs to Tools or Datatracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rewrite-ietf-id-urls-to-t/aiccdpabeagpjcebilebhlifplfkinao)**
Google Chrome extension that rewrites I-D URLs that point to www.ietf.org to point to datatracker.ietf.org or tools.ietf.org. 

- **[RFC-what-I-mean](https://www.strayalpha.com/tools/)**
Checks a list of RFCs to find the most recent list and their dependents. It needs to run with a copy of rfc-index.txt as input.

- **[rfc-mode](https://github.com/galdor/rfc-mode)**
A plugin Emacs major mode that provides support for reading RFCs.
