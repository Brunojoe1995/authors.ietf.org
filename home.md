Welcome to the Internet-Draft authors resource site.

This site is the main resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D) or those who want to author an I-D, with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this.  It does not cover the IETF [standards development process](https://www.ietf.org/standards/process/) or the RFC publication process.

**!! THIS SITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THE INFORMATION ON IT SHOULD NOT BE TRUSTED UNTIL IT GOES LIVE !!**
