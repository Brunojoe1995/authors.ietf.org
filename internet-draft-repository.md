All versions of Internet-Drafts are kept in the [Internet-Draft Archive](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id). Active versions of Internet-Drafts are also placed in the [Internet-Draft Repository](https://www.ietf.org/id).

Versions of Internet-Drafts are removed from the Repository when any of the following occur:

* The I-D is updated with a new version.
* The I-D is replaced by another Internet-Draft.
* The I-D is published as an RFC.
* The I-D expires.

An I-D expires 185 days after it was placed in the Repository, unless it is in a state that prevents it from expiring. Examples of such states include being processed by the IESG for publication in the IETF stream, or being under review by the Independent Series Editor (ISE) for publication in the [Independent Submission Stream](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/).

Internet-Drafts are not removed from the Archive when they are removed from the Repository. Removing an I-D from the Archive occurs only in exceptional circumstances, described in [this IESG Statement](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/internet-draft-removal/).

Even though Internet-Drafts are kept in the Archive, they are not an archival series and should not be cited or quoted as anything other than "work in progress".
