Drafting in plaintext can be achieved with any text editor or word processor and so no toolchains are listed here.  It should be noted that drafting in plaintext, in comparison to a markup language, requires authors to manually handle multiple sections of content and ensure that the document conforms to many formatting rules.

For details on the work needed to ensure that a plaintext is suitable for submission, see [Guidelines for plaintext I-Ds](/guidelines-for-plaintext-ids).

Some of the tools listed in [Drafting in other markup languages](/drafting-in-other-markup-languages) output plaintext only and that plaintext may also need further work.

Plaintext I-Ds can be validated prior to submission as explained in [Document validation](/document-validation).
