Plenty of help is available on authoring I-Ds, both direct from the IETF and from other members of the IETF community. If you do not know where to start or your issue type is not listed below please [email Support](mailto:support@ietf.org).  While we cannot answer all questions, we should be able to direct you to the right place where we can't.

Otherwise, there are a number of community mailing lists where more advanced questions can be posted or questions about tools outside of IETF control.  It is often worthwhile searching the list archive first.

* **XML2RFC Interest**
If your question relates to RFCXML or the xml2rfc tool and you cannot find the answer on this site then this list is a good place to start.  
([subscribe](https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/xml2rfc.ietf.org/) : [post](mailto:xml2rfc@ietf.org) : [archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/xml2rfc/))

* **RFC Markdown**
If your question relates to the use of Markdown by I-D authors or the Markdown specific tools then you should get an answer on this list.
([subscribe](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-markdown) : [post](mailto:rfc-markdown@ietf.org) : [archive](https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/rfc-markdown.ietf.org/))

* **RFC Interest**
This is a more general list for discussion of the RFC Series and all aspects of that including tools.  If your question is more about content or authoring processes then this is a good place to start though you may be redirected to somewhere more specific, dependingon the nature of your query.
([subscribe](https://mailman3.rfc-editor.org/mailman3/lists/rfc-interest.rfc-editor.org/) : [post](mailto:rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org) : [archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/rfc-interest/))

* **Tools Discuss**
This is an even more general list for discussion of the IETF Tools and their development.  If your question is about the Datatracker, including the I-D submission process or the I-D repository/archive then this is a good place to start.
([subscribe](https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/tools-discuss.ietf.org/) : [post](mailto:tools-discuss@ietf.org) : [archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/tools-discuss/))
