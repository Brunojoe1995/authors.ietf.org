The IETF provides a [web service](https://author-tools.ietf.org) that supports a range of common tasks, thereby reducing the need for authors to install and maintain key tools locally.  

This service is intended to accept files in a number of different formats and will automatically convert formats if necessary to perform the chosen task.  This allows this service to support a greater range of one-stop processes than the individual tools themselves.

The Author Tools web service is regularly enhanced and suggestions for new tasks to support are welcome.
