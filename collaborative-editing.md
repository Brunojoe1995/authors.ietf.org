Collaborative editing is generally the hardest part of authoring an I-D as you will need to keep on top of multiple changes from multiple sources.

# Comparing two I-Ds with rfcdiff
[rfcdiff](https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff) is a web service that provides a side-by-side comparison of two documents.  It is generally used to show the differences between two version of the same I-D to see what has changed, or between a submitted I-D and a working draft.
