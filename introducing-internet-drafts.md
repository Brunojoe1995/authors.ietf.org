Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF. They are the primary inputs into what may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).

Internet-Drafts are used by all of the [RFC Streams](https://rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8729). The guidance in this document applies to all streams unless it is identified as specific to a particular stream.

Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. This guidance uses the term "author", but the guidance applies to people acting in any role.

This document collects and summarizes requirements and guidance from many sources. The following resources should be consulted for definitive details:

* The IETF Standards Process is described in [RFC 2026](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2026).
* The IETF rules concerning copyright are described in [BCP 78](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp78).
* The IETF rules on IPR are described in [BCP 79](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp79).
* The IETF [Trust Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/), called "the TLP" for short, provides many details about copyright policy and practice.

Much of the guidance in this document is in the form of something that can be inspected, or checked, to see whether changes should be made before submitting an I-D. These items are marked with checkboxes ([ ]). However, authors are expected to be familiar with and to apply the full guidance in this document.

There are tools to help with the creation of Internet-Drafts. Rather than attempting to construct a plaintext Internet-Draft manually, it is highly recommended using a structured language for authoring, and a toolchain like [xml2rfc](https://pypi.org/project/xml2rfc/) or [kramdown-rfc2629](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629) to build a submission.

An [online converter](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/experimental.html) for documents in the [xml2rfc](https://pypi.org/project/xml2rfc/) or [kramdown-rfc2629](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629) input formats is available. Authors working with the xml2rfc XML source format should be familiar with [the XML grammar](https://rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7991) [that the xml2rfc tool currently accepts](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/xml2rfc-doc.html), and the [RFC Editor's FAQ on using the v3 XML format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/FAQ-xml2rfcv3.html).

As Internet-Drafts may be eventually published as RFCs, it is recommended to consult the [RFC Editor's publication process](https://www.rfc-editor.org/pubprocess/).
