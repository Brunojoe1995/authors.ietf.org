Writing Internet-Drafts is complex and time consuming and careful choice of authoring format and authoring tools can make this task much easier. Your choice of format and tools is likely to depend on what markup languages and document editing tools you are familiar with, and how you intend to work.  Your options are:
1. **RFCXML**.  This is the most popular choice as RFCXML is the markup language used for published RFCs and can be used end-to-end throughout the authoring process. However, RFCXML is also the most complex and best suits an author or group of co-authors who are very familiar with XML and who all have access to XML editing tools.  See [Drafting in XML](/drafting-in-xml) for more details.
1. **Markdown**.  This is the next most popular choice as Markdown is a simplified text markup language, used with one of the tools that converts Markdown to RFCXML.  See [Drafting in Markdown](/drafting-in-markdown) for more details.
1. **Other markup languages**.  If you are very familiar with one of the less well known text markup languages and their normal editors, for example LaTeX, nroff or Org Mode in Emacs, then this may be a good choice for you.  A number of these markup languages are supported by tools that can convert your text to either RFCXML or plaintext I-D format, though they may not be as well maintained or fully featured as the Markdown tools.  See [Drafting in other formats](/drafting-in-other-formats) for more details.
1. **Plain text**.  Plaintext documents are still accepted for I-Ds submission and many people work with plain text in one of two ways:
    1. Directly by creating plaintext documents in a text editor.
    1. Indirectly by authoring in a markup language and generating the plaintext from that.
  1.  **Word processors**.  Finally, there are a couple of tools that support word processors such as Microsoft Word, converting their output to RFCXML. See [Drafting in word processors](/drafting-in-word-processors) for more details.
